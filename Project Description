HindiCharRecognition.py

This python file contains the code for training and validating a Machine Learning model taking the dataset obtained from the ImagetoCSV.py as
input. This uses the keras API in TensorFlow and builds a model.

hindi_pred.py

This python file contains the code for loading the model and also contains the entire Computer Vision Code which is used to draw the Hindi 
Characters on the console.

ImagetoCSV.py

This python file contains code to convert the Image Dataset into a CSV file.
